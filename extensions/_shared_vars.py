  "That bowl is gnarly.",
  "Except for those dirty yellow rings!",
  "Kenneth! What are you doing?!",
  "You know, I don't even like honey!",
  "I don't eat it!",
  "We need to talk!",
  "He's just a little bee!",
  "And he happens to be",
  "the nicest bee I've met in a long time!",
  "Long time? What are you talking about?!",
  "Are there other bugs in your life?",
  "No, but there are other things bugging",
  "me in life. And you're one of them!",
  "Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...",
  "My nerves are fried from riding",
  "on this emotional roller coaster!",
  "Goodbye, Ken.",

  "Oh, well.",
  "Are you OK for the trial?",
  "I believe Mr. Montgomery",
  "is about out of ideas.",
  "We would like to call",
  "Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.",
  "Good idea! You can really see why he's",

  "Yeah.",
  "Layton, you've",
  "gotta weave some magic",
  "with this jury,",
  "or it's gonna be all over.",
  "Don't worry. The only thing I have",
  "to do to turn this jury around",

  "of what they don't like about bees.",
  "- You got the tweezers?",
  "- Are you allergic?",
  "Only to losing, son. Only to losing.",

  "- Yes.",

  "...bedbug?",
  "I've seen a bee documentary or two.",
  "From what I understand,",

  "- Yeah, but...",
  "- So those aren't your real parents!",
  "- Oh, Barry...",
  "- Yes, they are!",
  "Hold me back!",
  "You're an illegitimate bee,",
  "aren't you, Benson?",
  "He's denouncing bees!",
  "Don't y'all date your cousins?",

  "Oh, I'm hit!!",
  "Oh, lordy, I am hit!",
  "Order! Order!",
  "The venom! The venom",
  "is coursing through my veins!",
  "I have been felled",
  "by a winged beast of destruction!",
  "You see? You can't treat them",
  "like equals! They're striped savages!",

  "they know! It's their way!",
  "- Adam, stay with me.",
  "- I can't feel my legs.",
  "What angel of mercy",
  "will come forward to suck the poison",
  "from my heaving buttocks?",
  "I will have order in this court. Order!",
  "Order, please!",
  "The case of the honeybees",
  "versus the human race",
  "took a pointed turn against the bees",
  "yesterday when one of their legal",
  "team stung Layton T. Montgomery.",
  "- Hey, buddy.",
  "- Hey.",
  "- Is there much pain?",
  "- Yeah.",
  "I...",
  "I blew the whole case, didn't I?",
  "It doesn't matter. What matters is",
  "you're alive. You could have died.",
  "I'd be better off dead. Look at me.",
  "They got it from the cafeteria",
  "downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.",
  "Look, there's",
  "a little celery still on it.",
  "What was it like to sting someone?",
  "I can't explain it. It was all...",
  "All adrenaline and then...",
  "and then ecstasy!",
  "All right.",
  "You think it was all a trap?",
  "Of course. I'm sorry.",
  "I flew us right into this.",
  "What were we thinking? Look at us. We're",
  "just a couple of bugs in this world.",
  "What will the humans do to us",
  "if they win?",

  "That doesn't sound so bad.",
  "Adam, they check in,",
  "but they don't check out!",
  "Oh, my.",
  "Could you get a nurse",
  "to close that window?",
  "- Why?",
  "- The smoke.",

  "Right. Bees don't smoke.",
  "Bees don't smoke!",
  "But some bees are smoking.",
  "That's it! That's our case!",
  "It is? It's not over?",
  "Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.",
  "Get back to the court and stall.",
  "Stall any way you can.",
  "And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.",
  "Mr. Flayman.",
  "Yes? Yes, Your Honor!",
  "Where is the rest of your team?",
  "Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.",
  "Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,",
  "and as a result,",
  "we don't make very good time.",
  "I actually heard a funny story about...",
  "Your Honor,",

  "of this court's valuable time?",
  "How much longer will we allow",

  "Where is your proof?",
  "Where is the evidence?",
  "Show me the smoking gun!",
  "Hold it, Your Honor!",
  "You want a smoking gun?",
  "Here is your smoking gun.",
  "What is that?",
  "It's a bee smoker!",
  "What, this?",
  "This harmless little contraption?",
  "This couldn't hurt a fly,",

  "to bees who have never been asked,",

  "Sorry.",
  "I'm OK! You know what this means?",
  "All the honey",
  "will finally belong to the bees.",
  "Now we won't have",
  "to work so hard all the time.",
  "This is an unholy perversion",
  "of the balance of nature, Benson.",
  "You'll regret this.",
  "Barry, how much honey is out there?",
  "All right. One at a time.",
  "Barry, who are you wearing?",
  "My sweater is Ralph Lauren,",

  "- What do you mean?",
  "We've been living the bee way",
  "a long time, 27 million years.",
  "Congratulations on your victory.",
  "What will you demand as a settlement?",
  "First, we'll demand a complete shutdown",
  "of all bee work camps.",
  "Then we want back the honey",
  "that was ours to begin with,",
  "every last drop.",
  "We demand an end to the glorification",

  "It's the greatest thing in the world!",

  "Doesn't look very good, does it?",
  "No.",
  "And whose fault do you think that is?",
  "You know, I'm gonna guess bees.",
  "Bees?",
  "Specifically, me.",
  "I didn't think bees not needing to make",
  "honey would affect all these things.",
  "It's notjust flowers.",
  "Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.",
  "That's our whole SAT test right there.",
  "Take away produce, that affects",
  "the entire animal kingdom.",
  "And then, of course...",
  "The human species?",
  "So if there's no more pollination,",
  "it could all just go south here,",
  "couldn't it?",
  "I know this is also partly my fault.",
  "How about a suicide pact?",
  "How do we do it?",
  "- I'll sting you, you step on me.",

  "Right, right.",
  "Listen, Barry...",
  "sorry, but I gotta get going.",

  "Roses!",
  "Vanessa!",
  "Roses?!",
  "Barry?",
  "- Roses are flowers!",
  "- Yes, they are.",
  "Flowers, bees, pollen!",
  "I know.",
  "That's why this is the last parade.",
  "Maybe not.",
  "Could you ask him to slow down?",
  "Could you slow down?",
  "Barry!",
  "OK, I made a huge mistake.",
  "This is a total disaster, all my fault.",
  "Yes, it kind of is.",
  "I've ruined the planet.",
  "I wanted to help you",
  "with the flower shop.",
  "I've made it worse.",
  "Actually, it's completely closed down.",
  "I thought maybe you were remodeling.",
  "But I have another idea, and it's",
  "greater than my previous ideas combined.",
  "I don't want to hear it!",
  "All right, they have the roses,",
  "the roses have the pollen.",
  "I know every bee, plant",

  "How about The Princess and the Pea?",
  "I could be the princess,",
  "and you could be the pea!",
  "Yes, I got it.",
  "- Where should I sit?",
  "- What are you?",

  "- The pea?",
  "It goes under the mattresses.",
  "- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.",
  "- I'm getting the marshal.",
  "You do that!",
  "This whole parade is a fiasco!",
  "Let's see what this baby'll do.",
  "Hey, what are you doing?!",
  "Then all we do",
  "is blend in with traffic...",
  "...without arousing suspicion.",
  "Once at the airport,",

  "Stop! Security.",
  "- You and your insect pack your float?",
  "- Yes.",
  "Has it been",
  "in your possession the entire time?",
  "Would you remove your shoes?",
  "- Remove your stinger.",
  "- It's part of me.",
